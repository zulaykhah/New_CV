    <p>
        As an aspiring software developer, the need to acquiring skills to become Software Engineer is my mission.
        I am an intrigued learner and enjoyed being challenged with tasks that require me to work outside of my comfort knowledge set.
        I believe continuous learning is important to me and the success of any organization.
        My critical thinking, attention to details and people-centric nature have afforded me excellent decision-making skills.
